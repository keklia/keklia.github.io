<h2>Knitting</h2>
After some brief stints in elementary and middle school, as well as an extended crochet period, I started seriously knitting again in 2023. 

<h2>Crochet</h2>
I'm mostly retired from crochet in favor of knitting. Some favorite projects coming soon. <!-- But, here are some favorite projects from my crochet era. -->

<h2>Pottery</h2>

There are pottery studios in some of the residential colleges at Yale, so I started teaching myself how to throw on the wheel, first in Fall 2024 and more seriously in Spring 2025. 

Project pictures also to come soon. 

<!--I'd still consider myself an amateur, but here are some favorite projects. -->
